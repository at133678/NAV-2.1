<p>West High School student Alexa Christiansen, part of West’s Lemelson-MIT InvenTeam, wrote a grant that awarded West with  $10,000 for the 2nd time in three years.
  Students are working to create a water filtration system for Muamba, Kenya, which will potentially save millions of lives.
  West is one out of fifteen schools nationwide to receive this grant.
  They are excited to make a difference by providing a sustainable and inexpensive filtration system out of materials that would be available to villagers in Muamba.</p>
